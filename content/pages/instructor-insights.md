## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _9.70 Social Psychology_ as it was taught by Professor Stephan L. Chorover in Spring 2013.

This course examined interpersonal and group dynamics and considered how the thoughts, feelings, and actions of individuals are influenced by (and influence) the beliefs, values, and practices of large and small groups. Learning occurred through a combination of in-class activities, small study groups and regular homework assignments. The course also included occasional lectures and demonstrations.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

In this course, the instructor aimed to challenge the conventional "top-down" classroom arrangement, in which essentially everything of material and conceptual value presumably comes from "the front of the room" and, more specifically, from the uniquely powerful and centrally placed and particularly privileged position of the instructor-in-charge. The instructor aimed to replace this approach with an alternative that is scientifically credible, pedagogically sound, and educationally effective - a collaborative learning system.
